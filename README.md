# Sims-normal
Sims-normal is an RGB-based unsupervised benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in industrial assembly line actions, specifically designed for research in anomaly detection and action recognition on production lines.
Existing systems for assembly line action recognition primarily focus on identifying actions within standard operating procedures (SOP). However, these systems have limitations when dealing with actions performed by operators outside of SOP in real production environments. In practical operations, operators may perform behaviors that are not covered by SOPs, posing challenges to current systems. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset aimed at encompassing a more diverse range of operational behaviors.

The Simis-normal Dataset is a collection of simulated SOPs clips for production lines, at a resolution of [1280, 720] pixels and a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps). The camera angle is positioned above and in front of the operator, covering the upper part of the operator’s body and the operating area. The training set (hereinafter referred to as "Normal") of this dataset consists of videos from 9 operators performing the same SOP, with each operator contributing 6 videos, totaling 54 videos and 158,737 frames in total. Each video is annotated with frame-level action labels to support the training of action recognition models. The training set includes 6 actions of the camera assembly line SOP: Waiting, Brush, Assemble, Screw in, Scan, and Sticker. The testing set (hereinafter referred to as "Abnormal") contains 21 videos totaling 72,314 frames, including 9,546 frames with both SOPs and randomly occurring anomalous actions deliberately introduced to evaluate the model’s performance in recognizing non-SOP behaviors. The complete process of SOPs is defined as following: Waiting ⭢ Brush ⭢ Assemble ⭢ Screw in ⭢ Waiting ⭢ Assemble ⭢ Screw in ⭢ Waiting ⭢ Assemble ⭢ Screw in ⭢ Scan ⭢ Sticker ⭢ Waiting.
